- NFT artists

I got bored and made an NFT creator in python
Just to be clear: I don&#39;t trust NFTs and I don&#39;t think you should buy them
[My video about this](http://https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kEojGKt-pM "My video about this")

#### 1. Install python
Most systems come with python, but you can get it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/)
#### 2. Install dependencies
Run `dependencies.bat` for windows or `dependencies.sh` for linux and mac
If python isn't in your path you might need to do this manualy
#### 3. Add images
Place the images in the various layer folders, rare things can go in the rare subfolder
#### 4. (Optional) Change rarity
The rarity of rare layers can be changed in the source code by editing the lines specified, by default this is 1 in 100 for each rare layer
#### 5. Run generate.py to create an NFT
The NFT will be called `out.png` in the root folder, upload this to wherever you want
